Hello Team,

As per my thread title, I am unable to remote a 2016 DC. Following is the scenario;

My current forest structure is like <i>site1.childdomain.parentdomain.com</i>.
I am remoting through parentdomain.com. There is not trust between them. Its different entity, for testing purpose only.
So I added <i>*.childdomain.parentdomain.com</i> in trustedhost list. And then I was able to remote a <i>site1.childdomain.parentdomain.com</i> DC using its specif credential.
But I am unable to remote at <i>site2.childdomain.parentdomain.com</i> dcs.

I checked, IPv6 was Disable, Firewall was disabled, WSman running, its server 2016, yet I executed enable-psremoting, winrm qc. But no luck.

<b>Following is the error when I use ICM {gps} -cn <i>DC02.site2.childdomain.parentdomain.com</i>.</b>
[pre]Connecting to remote server <i>DC02.site2.childdomain.parentdomain.com</i> failed with the following error message : A specified

Finally, I did mstsc to the <i>DC02.<b>site1</b>.childdomain.parentdomain.com</i>, and use enter-pssession <i>DC02.<b>site2</b>.childdomain.parentdomain.com</i>. Now it worked.

I got frustrated. What is the issue then? Is any thing wrong with trusted host? I am suspecting this one, but as per logic it shouldn't be the issue.
Could anyone point me out.

Thank you.

Roy.
